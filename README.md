This package allows an Emacs user to create, delete, rename and fast swtich
between multiple inferior shells using
the [buffer-manager](https://github.com/plandes/buffer-manage) library.  This
is done by extending the `buffer-manage` and using its functions and
keybindings to manage multiple inferior shells.  To summarize, this includes:
* A major mode for switching to, deleting and starting new shells.
* Fast switching with customized key bindings through the customize framework.
* Track and rename shells by name through the shell entry management mode.
* Interact with buffer shell (entries) as objects with a straight forward
  API.


## Usage

Using the default bindings, use:
* `M-x bshell` or `C-x C-h` to create a new shell
* `C-tab` to enter the shell entry management mode.
* `C-c r` to rename the shell.
